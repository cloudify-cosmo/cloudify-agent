# The Diamond plugin is not included as a dependency in the setup.py since it breaks
# backwards compatibility with blueprints that require using an older version of the diamond-plugin.
# We do however still need the code to be installed since the diamond installation
# requires having compilation tools such as gcc, that we could not assume exist on any agent machine.
# Since the actual diamond version is consistent across all diamond-plugin versions,
# it would allow us to install any version of the diamond plugin, without needing gcc to recompile diamond.
