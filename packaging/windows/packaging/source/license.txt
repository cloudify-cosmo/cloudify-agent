   THESE TERMS CONSTITUTE THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF
THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, OR THE COMPANY ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU
ARE INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE, ("YOU") AND CLOUDIFY PLATFORM LTD.
("CLOUDIFY"), WHICH SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT,

SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED
RESULTS AND FOR THE INSTALLATION, USE AND RESULTS OBTAINED

Cloudify reserves the right, at its discretion, to change these Terms at any
time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the
revised Terms on https://cloudify.co/license, and your continued use of the
Software thereafter means that you accept those changes.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms,
   Cloudify grants you a limited, personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable,
   non-sublicensable license to use, only in binary executable form and script
   code form only, the Software, for your internal business purposes for up to
   10 Nodes (as defined below) managed by Cloudify. Currently the license for
   the Software granted hereunder is for free. The license for the Premium
   Software granted hereunder is for free for the first 60 days from

   fee for certain uses (including but not limited to non-personal use).
      If Cloudify does choose to charge, it will give you notice by posting the
   changes on its website, and charges will only be incurred by you if you
